    <p>Here's what I like to say about myself:</p>
    <p>One morning, Jenna awoke to find that she had transformed into a programmer. She's been psyched about coding ever since. She's currently swimming with JavaScript at <a href="http://digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean.</a> as the Engineering Manager for the Community Engineering and Creative Engineering teams.When she's not teaching pixels to party or helping keep engineers happy, Jenna enjoys climbing, coffee, and cat gifs. Her best party trick is that she wrote the most serious academic paper of her life— her <a href="http://bit.ly/punthesis">undergraduate honors thesis</a>— on puns.</p>

    <h3>Talks</h3>
    <p>I love giving talks at meetups and conferences. Here are slides and videos, when available</p>

      <!-- <li class="Talk">
        <h4>Server Farm to Table (or, how the Internet works)</h4>
        <p>Many of us depend on the internet for both work and play, but it's possible to go about our lives without knowing the steps it takes to get those pixels to show up and delight us and our users. However, a sense of the process of what's going on to serve web apps can help us as developers make better software as well as understand the motivation behind many of the optimizations that we've been taught. This talk will cover the life of a web request in a browser, from entering the URL to the processing the HTML, covering DNS, TLS, TCP, HTTP, and HTML parsing and rendering, explaining how each step in the process affects the performance of web apps.</p>

        <h4>What if your brain were ~*literally*~ JavaScript?</h4>
        <p>How does the human mind compare to JavaScript? In this talk, we'll explore three key components of cognitive science— language, knowledge representation, and attention— and compare them with concepts in JavaScript— JavaScript as a language, its object and prototype system, and its event loop.</p>

        <li><h4>NYC Camp's Frontend Camp</h4>
          <p><strong>The Linguistic Relativity of Programming Languages</strong></p>
          <p>The hypothesis of linguistic relativity, also known as the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, says that the languages we speak influence the way we think. I argue that this applies to programming languages as well. However, key differences between spoken languages and programming languages enable us to adapt and shift our ways of thinking more fluidly as we learn new programming languages than as we learn new spoken languages. It is these same differences that we can and should leverage to both grow individually as programmers and further advance our favorite programming languages. JavaScript is in a particularly ripe place to take advantage of these differences, as it is such a popular and dynamic (literally) language with a strong culture of libraries, evolution, ease of learning, and community.</p>

          <p>Baby's first NPM module. Parses Git diffs from a url or file into an array of JavaScript objects each representing changed files.</p>
          <p>This was a superb learning experience for really getting into node, understanding the module structures, requiring, and package.json files</p>

          <img class="portpic f-left" src="/Github-Readme-Imgs/initial.png" />
          <p>Web app that takes in an image and gives you back an image in which the colors are replaced with words that are semantically related with that color.</p>
          <p>For instance a patch of red might be replaced with the words "strawberry," "cherry," "balloon," etc.</p>
          <p>The project has modules that generate its own semantically related words, simplify the image into specified colors, and then make the image into the word picture, the first two of which are autonomous.</p>
