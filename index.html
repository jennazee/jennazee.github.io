    <p>Hey! I'm currently the manager of the Frontend Engineering team at <a href="http://digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean.</a> I get to  help people be the best programmers they can be all day and sometimes play with JavaScript, so that's pretty great.</p>

    <p>I also spent an awesome three months writing code as part of the fall 2012 batch of <a href="http://www.recurse.com">The Recurse Center</a> (then known as Hacker School). It was amazing. I love how code is, for me, the perfect combination of logic and creativity.</p>

    <p>In May 2012, I received an Sc.B in Cognitive Science at Brown, during which I completed my <a href="http://bit.ly/punthesis">honors thesis</a> in Professor Laura Kertz's <a href="http://research.clps.brown.edu/kertz/lab.html"> Sentence and Discourse Processing Lab</a>, investigating the nature of lexical access and lexical ambiguity resolution in dual-context sentences. In other words, I did my thesis on puns.</p>

    <p>I like thinking about the structure of the mental lexicon, the mental dictionary, and I'd like to learn more about distributed processing models of cognition, computational modeling, human computer interaction, user experience and usability, natural language processing, and data visualization. I also enjoy bouldering, <a href="//jennavsmarketshare.wordpress.com">cooking</a>, <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/jennaz">making mashups</a>, DJing, and drinking coffee.</p>

        <li><h4>Different</h4>
          <p class="techs">Technologies Used: js, node</p>
          <p>Baby's first NPM module. Parses Git diffs from a url or file into an array of JavaScript objects each representing changed files.</p>
          <p>This was a superb learning experience for really getting into node, understanding the module structures, requiring, and package.json files</p>

          <img class="portpic f-left" src="/Github-Readme-Imgs/initial.png" />
          <p>Web app that takes in an image and gives you back an image in which the colors are replaced with words that are semantically related with that color.</p>
          <p>For instance a patch of red might be replaced with the words "strawberry," "cherry," "balloon," etc.</p>
          <p>The project has modules that generate its own semantically related words, simplify the image into specified colors, and then make the image into the word picture, the first two of which are autonomous.</p>

        <li><h4>Coming Soon: RejectJS 2015 and Thunderplains 2015</h4>

        <li><h4>Texas JavaScript (txjs)</h4>
          <p><strong>What if your brain were ~*literally*~ JavaScript?</strong></p>
          <p>How does the human mind compare to JavaScript? In this talk, we'll explore three key components of cognitive science— language, knowledge representation, and attention— and compare them with concepts in JavaScript— JavaScript as a language, its object and prototype system, and its event loop.</p>

        <li><h4>NYC Camp's Frontend Camp</h4>
          <p><strong>The Linguistic Relativity of Programming Languages</strong></p>
          <p>The hypothesis of linguistic relativity, also known as the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, says that the languages we speak influence the way we think. I argue that this applies to programming languages as well. However, key differences between spoken languages and programming languages enable us to adapt and shift our ways of thinking more fluidly as we learn new programming languages than as we learn new spoken languages. It is these same differences that we can and should leverage to both grow individually as programmers and further advance our favorite programming languages. JavaScript is in a particularly ripe place to take advantage of these differences, as it is such a popular and dynamic (literally) language with a strong culture of libraries, evolution, ease of learning, and community.</p>
