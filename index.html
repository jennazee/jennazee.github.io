    <p>Hey! I'm currently a software engineer at <a href="http://www.bitly.com">Bitly.</a> I play with JavaScript all day and I love it.</p>

    <p>I also spent an awesome three months writing code as part of the fall 2012 batch of <a href="http://www.hackerschool.com">Hacker School</a>. It was amazing. I love how code is, for me, the perfect combination of logic and creativity.</p>

    <p>In May 2012, I received an Sc.B in Cognitive Science at Brown, during which I completed my <a href="http://bit.ly/punthesis">honors thesis</a> in Professor Laura Kertz's <a href="http://research.clps.brown.edu/kertz/lab.html"> Sentence and Discourse Processing Lab</a>, investigating the nature of lexical access and lexical ambiguity resolution in dual-context sentences. In other words, I did my thesis on puns.</p>

    <p>I like thinking about the structure of the mental lexicon, the mental dictionary, and I'd like to learn more about distributed processing models of cognition, computational modeling, human computer interaction, user experience and usability, natural language processing, and data visualization. I also enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee, <a href="//jennavsmarketshare.wordpress.com">cooking</a>, <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/jennaz">making mashups</a>, DJing, and drinking coffee.</p>

      <ul id='portlist'>
        <li><h4>Different</h4>
          <p class="techs">Technologies Used: js, node</p>
          <p>Baby's first NPM module. Parses Git diffs from a url or file into an array of JavaScript objects each representing changed files.</p>
          <p>This was a superb learning experience for really getting into node, understanding the module structures, requiring, and package.json files</p>

        <li><h4>Synesthesia</h4>
          <p class="techs">Technologies Used: Python, Python Imaging Library, PyGame, BeautifulSoup, js, jQuery, Flask, EC2</p>
          <img class="portpic float-left" src="/Github-Readme-Imgs/initial.png" />
          <p>Web app that takes in an image and gives you back an image in which the colors are replaced with words that are semantically related with that color.</p>
          <p>For instance a patch of red might be replaced with the words "strawberry," "cherry," "balloon," etc.</p>
          <p>The project has modules that generate its own semantically related words, simplify the image into specified colors, and then make the image into the word picture, the first two of which are autonomous.</p>

            <p>Javascript profiler that times and graphs the runtimes of an object's methods in real-time. It graphs methods either
            independently ("flat") or such that the run-time of a method is graphed inside the method that called it ("nested").</p>

      <h3>Language Processing Research </h3>
      <p> In April 2012, I completed my <a href="http://bit.ly/punthesis">honors thesis</a> on how we process puns in Laura Kertz's <a href="http://research.clps.brown.edu/kertz/lab.html">Sentence and Discourse Processing Lab</a> in Brown's <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/CLPS/">Department of Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences</a>. I have also done work investigating what motivates the existence of a linguistic phenomenon called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wh-movement#Extraction_islands">"extraction islands."</a></p>
      <p> In Summer 2011, I was honored to present at Brown's Summer Research Symposium, at which I presented <a href="UTRAPosterForWeb.pdf"> this poster</a>.</p>
      <p> While you're here, <a href="lexical.jpg"> take a look</a> at what I drew Hacker School to answer a question on their application that was something like "Explain something you know well as deeply as you can." I wrote about how we understand the intended meaning(s) of words with multiple meanings, a key thing in understanding puns</p>
